   jsx --> javascript xml, which permits to write html elements inside js file

    empty fragement --> <></>
    react is the library which allows JSX syntax
      className instead of class ( class is a keyword in js )
      class is a keyword for creating blueprints of user defined object
      because of which we need to use className instead of class in jsx syntax

      label for ---> htmlFor
    
    expressions or varaibles can be used in curly braces

    import/export

      normal import/export using curly braces / * as utils

      default import/export
    
    Script:
      dev, build, preview

    webpack/esbuild & babeljs conversion

    Virtual DOM:
      Real DOM: Tree like structure 
        html 
          head
            title
            script
            icon
          body
            div
            h1
            a
            p

      Virtual DOM: 
        it is an ** In Memory Copy of the real DOM ( <div id="root" ></div> ) ** used while manipulating the DOM.

      React  SPA:
      Virtual DOM
        The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

      Advantage: reconciliation process

        where the changes happens only in the virtual DOM which will be compared with old virtual DOM. And if any difference is found it will affected in the Real DOM. 

        No diff changes, Only memory/Virtual DOM changes not the real DOM

  Components (simple HTML layout to reusable react components)
    
    Styles styles
      inline style --> using it as object
        HTML Inline
          <img src='https://image.com/image.png' style="height: 200px; width: 100px" />
        React Inline
          <img src={props.imageUrl} style={{ height: '200px', width: '100px' }} />

      External Styling:
        normal styling using .css
    
    props: 
      the essential information needed to create a component for displaying the information

      attributes passed for a component is called as prop
      which can be used inside the props / destructured at component level 
    
    1. Working with array lists
        List Rendering 
          Usage of key is a must

    2. Conditional rendering

        Conditionally change the UI Design

        {/* Conditional Rendering changing the style using ? operator */}
        {/* Method 1 changing the style using ? operator */}
        <h2 style={{ textDecoration: isPassedOut ? "line-through" : "none" }}>
          {name}
        </h2>

        {/* Method 2 using the ? operator directly on the tag */}
        {isPassedOut ? (
          <h2 style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>{name}</h2>
        ) : (
          <h2>{name}</h2>
        )}

        {/* Method 3 using && */}
        {isPassedOut && (
          <h2 style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>{name}</h2>
        )}
        {!isPassedOut && <h2>{name}</h2>}

  proptypes:
    specifying the type of the props values needed to create a component
    this helps in reducing unwanted errors because of typeerror
